We use breadth first search + Dijkstra algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. 
To implement the Dijkstra algorithm, we use priority queue (i.e. heap) to find the edge
with minimum weight.

Suppose the set of vertexs and edges are V and E respectively. The time complexity is |E|+|V|log|V|
and the space complexity is |V| + |E|
